# Python code

We have developed a number of Jupyter notebooks &mdash; electronic documents that can also execute programming code &mdash; to help you learn web scraping.

You can download these notebooks to your own machine (instructions [here]()) but, for learning purposes, it is easier to just launch them in your browser &mdash; click on the button below. Using the notebooks this way means you do not need to install any software on your machine. Once the online service (Binder) has launched, click on the notebook you want to run. (*Don't worry if takes up to a minute to launch*)
