# Web scraping to build social research data

## Introduction

There is an unprecedented amount of information on the internet that could usefully be harvested in order to build social science research datasets.

This one-day online course will showcase suitable techniques for web scraping.

The value, logic and process of capturing data stored on websites will be described in detail, and practical examples and exercises will be demonstrated using the Python programming language.

It is most suited to empirical social science researchers.
